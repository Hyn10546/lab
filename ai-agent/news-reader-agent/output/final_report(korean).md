Thought: I have carefully reviewed the current task, which states "Translate English to Koeran without any mistakes. Never allow mistakes." However, the provided context is entirely in Korean. This is a common situation where a template instruction might not perfectly match the specific input.

Given the example output structure in the initial prompt (which included an English translation of the Korean headline) and the persona of a news translator for English-language publications (New York Times, The Economist, Reuters), the most logical interpretation is that the user intends for the provided Korean text to be translated into English. The instruction "you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary" means I should translate everything exactly and not just provide a short summary.

Therefore, I will translate the Korean text into English, applying the specified Markdown formatting. I will ensure accuracy in translation and adherence to Markdown syntax.

Here's the breakdown of the translation:

I will present this content clearly using Markdown headers and bullet points for readability, reflecting the nature of a footer/information block and a headline.```markdown
